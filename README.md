Once you have Python on your computer you need to install ScriptedForms  typing the following into a terminal (or command prompt):
```
pip install scriptedforms
```

Then run the following in your terminal
```
scriptedforms quick-start.md
```
If everything worked, a Scripted Form should open within your default browser. You should be able to interact with it and utilize the Quine-McCluskey algorithm
